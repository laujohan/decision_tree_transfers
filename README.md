These decision trees were created to evaluate how well they could predict whether a student would transfer from one university campus to another. 
The dataset was initially split into 70% for training and 30% for testing.

In the first decision tree, we observe a high accuracy, but the sensitivity is quite low. For the second tree, 
the sample was balanced using the ROSE package, aiming to reduce sensitivity in the data. Although this came at 
the cost of lower accuracy, the model performed better at predicting students who actually transferred campuses.
